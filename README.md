# Satire Or Not: exploring NLP techniques to detect Satire
## Introduction
The proliferation of both satirical news, embodied by outlets like The Onion, and genuine news across digital platforms has underscored the importance of developing sophisticated computational methods capable of navigating these distinctions. At the heart of this endeavor lies the exploration of NLP techniques to better understand and distinguish satire or genuine news headlines. By comparing the linguistic characteristics of these two types of headlines, we can gain insights into the role of language in satire and humor, as well as the ways in which NLP technique can be used to analyze and classify text data with the highest confidence.

## Data Description

### Overview of the Dataset:
For our analysis in satirical vs. non-satirical news headlines, we utilized a dataset available from the following [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lukefeilberg/onion). This dataset is specifically designed for distinguishing between satirical and non-satirical news titles, making it an ideal resource for our study, and it was large enough to provide a sufficient sample size for our purpose.

### What is the Onion?
The Onion is a satirical news organization that publishes articles and headlines that are intended to be humorous and satirical. 
It is known for its use of irony, parody, and satire to comment on current events and social issues. 
The Onion's headlines are often characterized by their use of wordplay, exaggeration, and absurdity to create humor and satire.
Analyzing The Onion's linguistic approach provides valuable insights into the role of morphology in satire, demonstrating how subtle manipulations of word structure can alter meaning and tone.
The Onion's content offers a rich resource for studying the interplay between language, culture, and humor, showcasing the power of morphology to both reflect and shape societal perceptions and attitudes.

### Dataset Structure:
Each entry in the dataset includes the news title and a binary label indicating whether the title is satirical (1) or non-satirical (0).
This structure allows for a direct comparison between the two types of titles in terms of their linguistic characteristics.

### Dataset Composition:
The dataset contains a significant number of titles, providing a robust sample for analysis.
It includes a diverse range of topics and styles, reflecting the wide array of subjects covered by both "The Onion" and traditional news outlets.
It does not need any cleaning or preprocessing, as it is already formatted in a way that is conducive to our analysis.
